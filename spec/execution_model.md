# Execution Model

## Control Flow

The *control flow* structures are special statement set that leads the flow of statements' execution.

### Conditionals

A *conditional* is a control structure that decides if a set of statements **MUST** be executed or not.

There are two conditional structures, *if* statement and *switch* statements.

To declare an *if* statement, use:

```
if condition {
    // statements
}
```

### Loops

### Conditional Loops

A *conditional loop* is a control structure that executes a set of statements while a condition is true.

There is one conditional loop available, that is the *while* statement.

The *while* statement continues its execution if the condition is true.

To use a *while* statement, use:

```
while condition {
    // statements
}
```
